Mention how your background/experience so far has guided your interest, and what about the work we are doing is a good fit for the kind of questions you see yourself investigating. Also, say a bit about what you are looking for in a graduate advisor/lab. Are you someone who works well under more structure or more freedom? What kind of logistical/social/academic support is most likely to help you succeed? I also encourage you to reach out to members or alums of this lab to gain some insight into what you might expect.\nFor those interested in getting undergraduate research experience:\nIf you can, then you should sign up for one of Dr. Rich’s elective classes - generally either Conservation Biology (offered every semester), Zoo Biology (offered every spring semester), or Human Health & the Environment (offered every fall semester). That is the best way to determine whether my research interests and the academic culture I foster align with your needs. You can enquire about opportunities in the lab at that time, or send an email. If we have some extra space available, you may start attending the weekly lab meetings. After that, students generally work out the level of commitment and independence they are looking for, and we plan your future in the lab from there.\nContact: Dr. Alicia Rich (Email)\n\n\n\n",
